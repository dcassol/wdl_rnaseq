# Welcome {-}

## About {.unnumbered}

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.height="200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22381693/69014860-a7299300-09e2-11ea-9d1a-1840d0d609d7.png")
```

This repository containers RNA-seq pipeline, docker container and sample data for testing.
Pipelines are written in [WDL language](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) and [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow execution engine is used to run them.

## Is this workflow useful for you? {.unnumbered}

**Expected output**

- `Fastqc` Quality Report 
- Reads Trimming with `Trimmomatic`
- Align Reads to Reference Genome using `HISAT2` (BAM files)
- Gene count table (raw)
- Differential Expression Matrix using `DESeq2`
- Create Feature set and Filtered Differential Expression Matrix

## Quick Start - No Installation required {.unnumbered}

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker run  -dP dcassol/wdl_rnaseq
docker ps 
docker exec -it <IMAGE NAME> /bin/bash
cromwell run rnaseq.wdl -i rnaseq.json -o rnaseq.options.json 
```

Now, you can test and edit the pipeline for your data. Have fun!

## Quick Start {.unnumbered}

**Step 1**: Clone the git repository to a directory on your computer:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
https://github.com/dcassol/wdl_rnaseq.git
```

Note: Ensure you have the correct permissions to run the pipeline - here we are using `Docker`. 
A further section will be provided containing more details if you are running in an HPC environment. 

**Step 2**: To run the pipeline use the command below:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cromwell run rnaseq.wdl -i rnaseq.json -o rnaseq.options.json 
## OR
java -jar cromwell-72.jar run rnaseq.wdl -i rnaseq.json -o rnaseq.options.json
```

Please, make sure use the correct PATH to `cromwell-72.jar` file.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'pipeline.bib')
```
