  abstract = "HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of
              transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads from
              RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based
              on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM)
              index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
              whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local
              FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's
              hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM
              indexes, each representing a genomic region of âˆ¼64,000 bp. Tests
              on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest
              system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than
              any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT
              requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of
              any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.",
